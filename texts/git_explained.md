# Git Explained## IntroductionMany challenges that we face as a society today, whether in business or private, is solved by software. In fact, many of us make a living out of it - by challenging the traditional approach and writing programs that can do it quicker and better. IT industry has been around for decades now, and it is said to be one of the basic canons of the economy of tomorrow. With world becoming ever more connected and more competitive it's vital for us to be as productive in our work as possible. The days when you were able to write the entire system in your basement and sell it to the world are over. Nowadays software is a team effort - you have to collaborate with other people, often distributed across the globe. The question is, how can we do it effectively?In this tutorial we will answer this very question. We will walk you through the tools that enable you and your team to work collectively on the same codebase, and explain its ins and outs. The goal is to make you a power user of Git. It  is one of the most popular version control system today and it is used by dev teams around the world.In this series we will take a non-traditional approach. We believe that you can truly understand this tool once you understood its internal mechanics. We will start with the big picture - the why and how. Next we will shift our attention to Git internals where we will explain what is going on under the hood. Finally, we will examine various scenarios and explain what Git is really doing. This way you can invest your time on solving real problems and not figuring out how you should be using a tool that is supposed to be a second nature to every developer. Many other tutorials take a rather easier approach when they explain Git using anecdotes and best practices. We believe this is a very dangerous approach in the long run. The minute something goes out of your playbook you are in trouble. You are more likely to make a mistake and fixing it will take you way more time than it should. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you almost always make a well informed decision and avoid mistakes. ## The big picture In this section we will briefly explain what a version control system is, and what problems it is designed to solve. Next we will see how these objectives can be met by examining few most common workflows. Every team and project is different and how teams incorporate version control system into their workflow is their individual decision. We will cap this section with a quick overview of Git and what distinguishes Git from other version control systems.###What's version control system? Version control system can be understood quite literally. It's a database system that records versions of your files. It's a system that allows you to take snapshots of your code and save it to the database. Later you can explore this history and do all sorts of useful things with it. ###Why teams use VCS?**Collaboration** For a second let's consider how team of developers could work on the same codebase. They would probably have to use some shared folder for their code and constantly talk to one another who's working on which files in order to avoid overwriting someone else's changes. This approach is very time consuming and error-prone. VCS puts a workflow in place which allows multiple people working at the same time on shared codebase and reconciles any conflicts in a very scrutinized way.**Audit** Because software nowadays is team effort it is very important that the evolution of the code can be easily explained - who did this change, when and why. Auditing is at the core of VCS - it literally records versions of your files. Each new version of a file is labeled with a description, its author and a timestamp. VCS provides means to query the history of file which proved to be very efficient way of learning how and why software evolved in a particular way. Another aspect is regulatory constraints - almost every commercial software requires transparent history of the code. **Backup** Unfortunately, we make mistakes. If we think for a second about our fictitious setup when developers were using shared folder - what would happen when someone made a mistake which must have been rolled back (to undo the last change). In a shared folder scenario it would have been close to impossible. VCS on the other hand works as a database, documenting evolution of your code and enables you to "go back in time" and revert your code to the past state. ###How teams use VCSThe idea of VCS doesn't enforce one particular way of working. Each projects is different and it's team's responsibility to adopt a workflow which suits them best. VCSs have been around for quite some time and few workflows emerged as the most popular.**Centralized** In centralized workflow we have an official repository. It's goal is to provide one focal point from where all developers in the team take the latest code. Every developer subscribes to the official repository - creates a copy on their PC, makes changes locally and then pushes them to the official repository. Once these changes are in the official repository they become visible to all other developers.[PICTURE-CENTRALIZED-WORKFLOW] **Distributed** In centralized workflow we had only one repository to which developers subscribe. In distributed workflow we have many. It usually suits large projects with large number of contributors. Two workflows worth examining are the ones used by GitHub and Linux communities. In GitHub we usually have one official repository. Developers can fork it - create a copy of this repository (which is publically available) which belongs to this developer. They as well as other people can contribute to this forked repository (from their local copies which subscribe to them). Once their project is completed (eg development of a new feature) they can request the official repository to include their changes into the official code (it's usually called creating a pull request and it's often done via some integration repository in which others can validate that new changes are well integrated with the larger system). Picture below illustrates it. [PICTURE-GITHUB-WORKFLOW]Linux kernel is one of the largest projects and over time it developers its own workflow with lieutenants. Each lieutenant is responsible for integrating changes from a particular area of larger system, and later promoting them to dictator who has a final say what goes into the official repository. Below picture depicts this workflow. [PICTURE-LINUX-WORKFLOW]###Git approach Git in its nature is a distributed system, however, flexible enough so it can easily accommodate a centralized workflow too. In contrast to many other version control systems, like SVN or Perforce, when you subscribe to the remote repository Git creates a full-featured repository on your local PC. It's not just a copy of the current code, you actually get the entire history of all files. Another big different compare to other popular systems is that Git, because of how it's organized, encourages certain habits - frequent check-ins (committing your changes), and branching. We'll talk about branching more in the next section - this is a very useful feature, however, it is quite cumbersome to use in other systems. Git is also well suited for scripting - many teams wrote their own scripts sitting on top of Git. In fact it created a platform for few commercial applications. ## Git internals This section will explain how you can get started with Git. Then we will do few basic operations and dive right into the internals of Git - what is actually going on under the hood. ###Installing GitIn order to install Git go to     https://git-scm.com/and download the latest Git release. If you are installing it on Windows OS, at some point installation wizard will prompt you with the option to "Adjusting your PATH environment".  Select "Run Git and include Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" - there is a red warning next to it. It replaces Windows' find command (no-one uses it anyway) with its Unix version which is much more powerful, and adds few more commands, eg ls.###First steps Now we have Git installed on our machine, so let's create a new repository and make some changes to it. Next, we'll see what Git actually stores this information. First, let's navigate to the folder where we want to create a new repository (feel free to locate it elsewhere, it doesn't matter). In this tutorial we will be interacting with Git via command line.    $ cd c:\    $ mkdir git    $ cd git    $ mkdir test_repo    $ cd test_repo Let's create a new Git repository    $ git init Initially our folder was empty. This command created a hidden folder (.git) which tells Git that this folder (test_repo) is now a repository. .git folder is going to store all information relating to your repository - history of files, all versions, their descriptions and many more.Let's now create a file and commit it to our repository. For brevity we'll do everything in console.    $ echo aaa >> a.txtThis command prints "aaa" into a a.txt file. Now we want to commit this file to our repository (create the first snapshot). We can do it by running this one command (later we will show you a different way which gives you more control over what happens)    $ git add .    $ git commit -m "Initial commit - added a.txt"Let's make some more changes: let's update a.txt file and create a new one.    $ echo bbb >> a.txt    $ echo 123 >> b.txtLet's now add them to the repository    $ git add .    $ git commit -m "Updated a.txt and created b.txt"OK. Now it's a good time to look retrospectively what has just happened. In the previous section we said that Git (like any other version control system) records changes that happens to our software. In this repo we recorded 2 changes* First, when we created a.txt file with "aaa"* Second, when we updated a.txt by adding second line with "bbb" and created a new file, b.txt with "123"Git's job is to record them (on our request) and allow us to view this history. We can easily view this history by running the following command.    $ git log The output can look like this    commit 153d89cc82fd77ff09e73000f8fd35127e64aa39    Author: Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com>    Date:   Sun Oct 16 23:23:06 2016 +0100        Updated a.txt and created b.txt    commit e0ec7d7cc6370de76b457bb20910cb0d685bd0f0    Author: Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com>    Date:   Sun Oct 16 23:22:26 2016 +0100        Initial commit - added a.txtThis shows journal of all changes that we made in our repository. As you can see the most recent change is listed at the top. As we can see, each commit has a unique ID (the 40-character long string next to the word commit). This is how Git identifies commits. In fact, when we ran     $ git commit [...]    Git creates a commit object which encapsulates all relevant information for that snapshot and stores it in .git folder. More about that in the next section.###Object-based databaseAll files related to the management process of our repository are stored in .git folder that was created when we ran $ git init command. Let's navigate to that folder and see what's in it     $ cd .git    $ ls -l    As we can see that are few folders in it. For the time being we will focus on objects folder and as we advance further in this tutorial we will come back here and talk about the remaining ones.    $ cd objects     $ ls -l    There are quite a few folders with names only 2-characters long. When Git creates objects it gives each object an ID (40 character long) and splits it into prefix and suffix 2+38 respectively. The prefix is used to create a folder and inside that folder it creates a file named using suffix. So if we look at our most recent commit its ID is 153d89cc82fd77ff09e73000f8fd35127e64aa39 and indeed we can see "15" folder. If we enter that folder we can see a file which name's correspond to the last 38 characters of the ID.     $ cd 15    $ ls -l    If we try to open this file in any text editor we will find out that it's content is not readable. Git in order to preserve space on your drive compresses these files. Fortunately, we can use one of many git commands to read the content of that file, referning it by the ID.    $ git cat-file -p 153d89cc82fd77ff09e73000f8fd35127e64aa39    The output    tree 40605725a8fef247117f96546f88e139365849a8    parent e0ec7d7cc6370de76b457bb20910cb0d685bd0f0    author Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com> 1476656586 +0100    committer Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com> 1476656586 +0100    Updated a.txt and created b.txt    At the very bottom we can see the description that we gave to that commit when we created it. It also has an information about committer and author. Lastly we see 2 entries, parent and tree. However, they are  different than all other entries. Instead of having any infromation they reference other files (by their IDs). If we look carefully we notice that the 40-character long ID next to parent is exactly the same as ID of the first commit. This tells Git what was the previous state (the previous commit) of our files. Every commit (except from the first commit) has at least one parent. We'll talk later when a commit can have multiple parents. To visually represent this notion you can think that each commit has a pointer to their parent commit - the one that happen before. This creates a directed graph.[PICTURE-2-COMMITS]The last thing that must discuss here is tree entry. This entry points to the state of our files. So let's see what's in it. Git allows us to interrogate all of its files, so we can use exactly the same command to inspects its content.    $ git cat-file -p 40605725a8fef247117f96546f88e139365849a8    The output is     100644 blob d2260f8cf9979e1d457aa040b73f61244a902d82    a.txt    100644 blob fb0a03d992212388b6835ab96fe4affa483a100b    b.txt    It depicts how our repository looked like when we made a commit. At that time we had 2 files, and they both are represented by Git objects. If we drill down to any of them we'll see their content at that time.     $ git cat-file -p d2260f8cf9979e1d457aa040b73f61244a902d82Git stores the entire content of that file (at the time of the snapshot), not just changes that we've made. Git is very space efficient in doing so and there is no need to be worried. To the left of the ID we have "blob". This is type of the file. If we would have a folder in our directory it would be represented by a file of a type "tree". Drilling down into this file would reveal its content, just like we've done it here. The picture below visualizes how our repository could be represented.[PICTURE-GIT-COMMITS-AND-FILES]During the evolution of your repository Git simply grows its files representing various objects. This is essentially Git's database storing history of everything that happened in your repo.     ### References and branches Previous section explained how Git stores all the information about commits. During the inspection we learned that commits point to their parent commits (ones that happened immediately before). Therefore Git must knows which commit is the last one. Indeed, when we run log command it shows the most recent commit at the top. Git stores the reference to the most recent commit and it is called HEAD. Not surprisingly, HEAD is a file in .git folder. We can inspect its content.    $ tail .git\HEAD    It prints     ref: refs/heads/masterIt simply represents a reference to another file. If we navigate to that file and open it up we'll find that this file contains only 40-character long ID (of the last commit).    $ tail .git\refs\heads\master     It prints     153d89cc82fd77ff09e73000f8fd35127e64aa39    which is ID of the last commit. Let's create another commit to see what happens.    $ echo ccc >> a.txt    $ git add .    $ git commit -m "Added ccc to a.txt"    master file was updated and now it points to the most recent commit. We can also see it using --decorate option for log command.    $ git log --oneline --decorate     It shows    576bdf0 (HEAD -> master) Added ccc to a.txt    153d89c Updated a.txt and created b.txt    e0ec7d7 Initial commit - added a.txtBy default log command is quite verbose and for brevity we used here additional parameters. --oneline presents log in abbreviated format, and --decorate includes information about references. In this case it shows that the last commit is marked as HEAD, and HEAD is pointing to master. Master is not some random file. It's a branch. Every Git repository is created, by default, with a single branch called master. As you can see from the above, branch is just a pointer to the commit. We can see all branches in our repository by running     $ git branch     It shows     * master    We only have one branch, * next to the name of the branch indicates our currently checked out branch. Let's create a new branch then. We can do it by running     $ git branch experiment     If we re-run branch command we get       experiment    * master    Now we've got 2 branches. Since branches are just stored in files, we can inspect them.    $ cd .git/refs/heads/    $ ls -l    $ type experiment     $ type master     Both of them point to the same commit. We can also see it reflect in log.    $ cd ..\..\..    $ git log --oneline --decorate     Prints:    576bdf0 (HEAD -> master, experiment) Added ccc to a.txt    153d89c Updated a.txt and created b.txt    e0ec7d7 Initial commit - added a.txtGit encourages developers to work on branches, where each branch represents a stream of work - for example a development of a new feature, or a bug fix. First let's see it in practice. Let's first check out branch - it tells Git on which branch we want to work now.    $ git checkout experiement     We can also inspect quickly how HEAD look now.     $ tail .git\HEAD    HEAD is now poitning to experiment, whereas it was previously pointing to master. Let's make some changes to our files and commit them     $ echo ddd >> a.txt    $ git add .     $ git commit -m "Added ddd to a.txt"    Let's see how it is reflected in log.    $ git log --oneline --decorate     It prints     ab63fa7 (HEAD -> experiment) Added ddd to a.txt    576bdf0 (master) Added ccc to a.txt    153d89c Updated a.txt and created b.txt    e0ec7d7 Initial commit - added a.txtWhat's interesting is that we created a new commit (listed at the top), and experiment branch is pointing to it. However, master branch "didn't move". It points to the third commit as it was before. That's because we checked out to experiment branch, which essentially told Git that now we are working on this branch and any commits should be commited to this branch. If we inspect the content of the last commit we will learn that it references 3rd commit as its parent.     $ git cat-file -p ab63fa7    It prints     tree 966f4a6af5210044f777610113d9aaf454eed377    parent 576bdf0a798ca46a02802e052ee6ae58cb5aaf82    author Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com> 1476657536 +0100    committer Karol Gornicki <karol.gornicki@gmail.com> 1476657536 +0100    Added ddd to a.txtOur repository can be depicted as a graph [PICTURE-REPO-GRAPH]In the next section we will show how we can join branches (Git calls it merging), but before that we have to revisit the checkout command. We said that it tells Git on which branch we want to work (it updates HEAD file to point to the branch selected by us). Obviously we can have more than one branch, so what exactly happens when we switch branches. Let's to the experiement. At first, let's print the content of a.txt (tail prints the last 10 lines of a file).        $ tail a.txt    We can see all 4 lines. Let's now switch to master and inspect the same file.    $ git checkout master     $ tail a.txt    It doesn't have the last line - "ddd". This goes back to the point when we talked about commit objects - they store full content of all files in our repo. When we checkout a branch (and remember, branch is just a pointer to a commit object) Git updates all files to the state as of that commit. If we now run log command     $ git log --oneline --decorate     we will see only 3 commits - branch master doesn't know about branch experiment, and it shouldn't. 576bdf0 commit only has a pointer to its parent (previous) commit, not the future ones.In the next section we'll explain some more advanced concepts, like 3 states in working directory, merging and rebasing.     ## Working with Git (locally)3 states ... Merging ... ## Working with Git (remotely)Why ...How to do ...## FAQ...
