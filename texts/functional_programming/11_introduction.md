#Introduction

Throughout this tutorial we will be using F# code to demonstrate discussed concepts. In this segment we would like to familiarize you with basic F# syntax. We will assume that you already had some experience with at least one mainstream object-oriented language such as C++, C# or Java and the concepts of classes, methods, and objects are not new to you. 

F# syntax, at its core, is quite simple. All being equal there are quite a few things that we would like to change about the language but that’s a story for another time. 

F# is functional-first programming language. That means, it embraces the concept of functional programming (e.g. higher order functions) but also allows for imperative programming which is mainly attributed to side effects (e.g. printing to console, mutable data structures). It allows you to structure your applications in both paradigms keeping practicality in mind - if it’s better to express the concept using functional paradigm, or imperative than do what’s simpler. Whether that’s a good idea people can argue - some will definitely find it an acceptable trade-off.
