#Processing data structures

In this segment we will talk how you should use data structures in F# in the most idiomatic way. What does that mean? - it means how to use them in a way that is natural to F# and functional paradigm.

You will probably agree with us that every competent .NET developer must be familiar with generic collections like List<T> or dictionaries - understand how they are built and which should be used to solve different problems efficiently. 

F# has its own collections. F# decided to develop a new set of data structures in order to:

* Make them immutable 
* Make them easy to process in a functional manner
