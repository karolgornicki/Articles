#Orientation to this series

We assume that you have some prior programming experience with C-like language and that you are familiar with basic concepts of object oriented design (variable, class, constructor and such).

We will start with quick introduction to F# - the basics everyone must know. 

The next two blocks break down the essence of functional programming - functions and data structures. Each of two parts is made up of few essays, each containing a problem to solve and code solution. 

We will close this series with essays demonstrating how to solve more complicated problems - from start to end. Each problem is analyzed - based on that we make decision how our algorithm must be designed, how does it shape our data structures. We end each essay with full solution.
