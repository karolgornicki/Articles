#The goal of this seriesThe goal of this series of essays is to familiarize you with the idea of functional programming - explain what it is, and demonstrate techniques which you can use to solve problems. Rather than talking about theoretical properties of a language we find a hands-on approach to be more effective. Itâ€™s better when you can experiment with the language on your own and grow your confidence. Use the following essays as starting points. Each essay contains code snippets in F# with full explanations.We tried to keep this series language-agnostic and focus on essentials of functional programming which are applicable in any language that claims to be functional.
