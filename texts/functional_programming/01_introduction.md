#Introduction Functional programming is back in business and it is almost certainly the next big thing.The concept of functional programming isn’t new. It was invented about the same time the first procedural languages came to existence - in the late ‘50s. Back then languages like FORTRAN, and later BASIC, C, C++ and more recently Java and C#, have proved time after time, to be more efficient in solving real-life problems. And this is now about to change. In the past concurrency was not an issue. We had one processor and the strategy was to make it run faster and faster. At some point this idea ran out of steam and the new approach was to increase the number of cores. That required us to modify our programming techniques - in order to utilize all of our cores our program must execute in parallel - different cores compute different parts of our program and at the end results are consolidated. Languages like C++ can handle it but there is one problem. It’s hard to get this right. Functional languages on the other hand make it significantly easier, if not trivial in many cases. Over time we also started to realize another aspect of procedural (and object-oriented) programming. It tends to lead to very complex solutions, especially for enterprise-level applications. This makes them very expensive - to write and later to maintain. Functional programming offers new ways to control complexity.Next: [The goal of this series](02_goal_of_this_series.md)
