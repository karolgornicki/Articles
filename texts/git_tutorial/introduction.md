# Introduction

Many challenges that we face as a society today, whether in business or private, is solved by software. In fact, many of us make a living out of it - by challenging the traditional approach and writing programs that can do it quicker and better. IT industry has been around for decades now, and it is said to be one of the basic canons of the economy of tomorrow. With world becoming ever more connected and more competitive it's vital for us to be as productive in our work as possible. 

The days when you were able to write the entire system in your basement and sell it to the world are over. Nowadays software is a team effort - you have to collaborate with other people, often distributed across the globe. The question is, how can we do it effectively?

In this tutorial we will answer this very question. We will walk you through the tools that enable you and your team to work collectively on the same codebase, and explain its ins and outs. The goal is to make you a power user of Git. It  is one of the most popular version control system today and it is used by dev teams around the world.

In this series we will take a non-traditional approach. We believe that you can truly understand this tool once you understood its internal mechanics. We will start with the big picture - the why and how. Next we will shift our attention to Git internals where we will explain what is going on under the hood. Finally, we will examine various scenarios and explain what Git is really doing. 

This way you can invest your time on solving real problems and not figuring out how you should be using a tool that is supposed to be a second nature to every developer. 

Many other tutorials take a rather easier approach when they explain Git using anecdotes and best practices. We believe this is a very dangerous approach in the long run. The minute something goes out of your playbook you are in trouble. You are more likely to make a mistake and fixing it will take you way more time than it should. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you almost always make a well informed decision and avoid mistakes.
