## Git tutorial 

This tutorial is designed to make you a power user of Git. It takes a rather non-traditional approach compare to other tutorials. We believe you can truly understand Git by learning its internal mechanics in the first place. Then you can apply this knowledge in various use cases. This way you can always make well informed decision rather than relying on best practices without really knowing what Git does under the hood.
