# ArticlesThis page is a collection of various work I've done. ## Git tutorial This tutorial is designed to make you a power user of Git. It takes a rather non-traditional approach compare to other tutorials. We believe you can truly understand Git by learning its internal mechanics in the first place. Then you can apply this knowledge in various use cases. This way you can always make well informed decision rather than relying on best practices without really knowing what Git does under the hood.* [**Introduction**](texts/git_tutorial/introduction.md) - why should you care?* [**The big picture**](texts/git_tutorial/the_big_picture.md) - what is it and what problems does it solve?* [**Git internals**](texts/git_tutorial/git_internals.md) - how does it work under the hood?* Working with Git locally - this series applies use case apprach demonstrating how to use Git * [**Branching and merging**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_merging_strategies.md) * [**Three states**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_three_states.md) * [**Patching**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_patching.md) * [**Undo**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_undo.md) * [**Stashing**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_stashing.md) * [**Exploring history**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_exploring_history.md) * [**Ignoring files**](texts/git_tutorial/working_locally_gitignore.md)* Working with Git remotely - series of use cases how to work with a remote repository * [**Cloning**](texts/git_tutorial/working_remotely_cloning.md) * [**Receiving updates**](texts/git_tutorial/working_remotely_receiving_updates.md) * [**Adding and deleting branches**](texts/git_tutorial/working_remotely_adding_branches.md) * [**Pushing changes**](texts/git_tutorial/working_remotely_pushing_changes.md) ## Data science tutorial The aim of this tutorial is to walk you through some basics of R and provide an accelerated introduction to data science with main focus on machine learning. The material is organized in a series of lectures. Each lecture contains comments explaining all commands, and concepts. In theory everyone should be able to follow along the material without any external help.Upon completion of this tutorial you should be comfortable working with R and RStudio, be able to write your own scripts analysing some data, and create simple prediction models preceded by some data mining/cleaning activities.Before you start* Download and install R from https://www.r-project.org/* Download and install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/Lectures * [**Lecture #1 - Data structures**](texts/data_science/lecture_01_data_structures.md)* [**Lecture #2 - Subsetting**](texts/data_science/lecture_02_subsetting.md)* [**Lecture #3 - Manipulating data structures**](texts/data_science/lecture_03_manipulating_data_structures.md)* [**Lecture #4 - Reading and saving data**](texts/data_science/lecture_04_reading_and_saving_data.md)* [**Lecture #5 - Functions**](texts/data_science/lecture_04_reading_and_saving_data.md)* [**Lecture #6 - Scoping**](texts/data_science/lecture_06_scoping.md) (optional)* [**Lecture #7 - Exploratory analysis**](texts/data_science/lecture_07_exploratory_analysis.md)* [**Lecture #8 - Creating na√Øve prediction models models**](texts/data_science/lecture_08_creating_naive_prediction_models.md)* [**Lecture #9 - Introduction to machine learning**](texts/data_science/lecture_09_introduction_to_machine_learning.md)* [**Lecture #10 - Practical machine learning**](texts/data_science/lecture_10_practical_machine_learning.md)* [**Lecture #11 - Predicting titanic survivors using machine learning**](texts/data_science/lecture_11_predicting_titanic_survivors_using_machine_learning.md)* [**References**](texts/data_science/references.md)## Functional programming *This section is under construction.** **Introduction**  * [**Introduction**](texts/functional_programming/01_introduction.md)  * [**The goal of this series**](texts/functional_programming/02_goal_of_this_series.md)  * [**Orientation**](texts/functional_programming/03_orientation_to_this_series.md)  * [**By the end ...**](texts/functional_programming/04_by_the_end.md)* **F# Basics**  * [**Introduction**](texts/functional_programming/11_introduction.md)  * [**Installing F#**](texts/functional_programming/12_installing_fsharp.md)  * [**Creating a new project**](texts/functional_programming/13_creating_a_new_project.md)  * [**Structure of programs**](texts/functional_programming/14_structure_of_programs.md)  * [**F# interactive**](texts/functional_programming/15_fsharp_interactive.md)Old material (to be reviewed):* [Problem - Largest product in a grid](texts/project_euler_problem_11.md)
