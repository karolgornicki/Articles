## Git tutorial 

This tutorial is designed to make you a power user of Git. It takes a rather non-traditional approach compare to other tutorials. We believe you can truly understand Git by learning its internal mechanics in the first place. Then you can apply this knowledge in various use cases. This way you can always make well informed decision rather than relying on best practices without really knowing what Git does under the hood.

## Data science tutorial 

The aim of this tutorial is to walk you through some basics of R and provide an accelerated introduction to data science with main focus on machine learning.

The material is organized in a series of lectures. Each lecture contains comments explaining all commands, and concepts. In theory everyone should be able to follow along the material without any external help.

After completion of the tutorial you should be comfortable working with R and RStudio, be able to write your own scripts analysing some data, and create simple prediction models preceded by some data mining/cleaning activities.
